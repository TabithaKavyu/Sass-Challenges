/*Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. 
This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.
Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file.*/

/*Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the main.scss file.*/

// The main.scss file
@import 'variables'
