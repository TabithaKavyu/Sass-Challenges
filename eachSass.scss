/*Sass also offers the @each directive which loops over each item in a list or map.
On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

/*Write an @each directive that goes through a list: blue, black, red and assigns each variable to a .color-bg class, where the "color" part changes for each item.
Each class should set the background-color the respective color.*/
